  - # Reflections
I learned that forks allow you to edit the original repo of someone else allowing you to contribute to that project directly. I learned that you can request to make changes to someone elses project via pull request. Both of these features show that github is very good for collaborate with others.
  - # Confusions
I learned that you can create branches to seperate your work essentially creating a copy of your repository and editing that. I believe I understand it but don't understand why you cannot make changes and save previous versions.
